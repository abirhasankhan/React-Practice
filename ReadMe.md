# React Practice Project

This project showcases my journey of learning React by building a basic counter app, exploring Tailwind CSS, and creating a custom React application. I used **Vite** as the build tool to enhance performance and streamline the development process.

## Features

- **Basic Counter App**: A simple app where users can increment, decrement, and reset a counter. This project helped me understand React fundamentals, including state management and event handling.
  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Integrated Tailwind CSS for fast, responsive UI design.

- **Custom React App**: Created a more advanced React app to practice concepts like component reusability, props, hooks, and state management.

## Tech Stack

- React.js
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

To run the project locally with Vite, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd react-practice-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server using Vite:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Lessons Learned

- Understanding React's component structure and managing state with hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
- Styling efficiently with Tailwind CSS.
- Using **Vite** for faster builds and smoother development experience.
- Building reusable and maintainable React components.
