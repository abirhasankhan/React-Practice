# React Practice Project

This project demonstrates my journey in learning React through a series of hands-on, interactive projects. By building a basic counter app, exploring Tailwind CSS for styling, and creating more advanced applications like a background color changer and a password generator, I gained practical experience in React development. I used **Vite** as the build tool for fast performance and a smooth development process.

## Features

- **Basic Counter App**: Users can increment, decrement, and reset the counter. This project solidified my understanding of React's core concepts, including state management (`useState`) and event handling.
  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Integrated Tailwind CSS to speed up UI development with responsive design and utility-first classes.

- **Custom React App**: Created an advanced React app to practice key React concepts, such as component reuse, passing data with props, and managing state with hooks like `useEffect`.

- **Background Change App**: An interactive app where users can dynamically change the background color by clicking different color buttons, reinforcing my understanding of event handling and state updates.

- **Password Generator App**: A tool to generate strong, random passwords based on user input (length, special characters, etc.). This project emphasizes handling forms, dynamically updating content, and using hooks such as `useCallback`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` for efficient state management.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: Core framework used to build dynamic, interactive UIs.
- **Vite**: Utilized for rapid builds and a smoother development environment.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for efficient and responsive styling.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally with Vite:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd react-practice-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Lessons Learned

- Mastered React's component structure and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for managing state and side effects.
- Improved styling workflow with Tailwind CSS, creating clean, responsive UIs without writing custom CSS.
- Leveraged **Vite** for faster builds, hot module replacement, and an optimized development experience.
- Built reusable components to simplify code structure and improve maintainability.
- Enhanced interactivity with state-based background color changes in the UI.
- Implemented a dynamic password generator that handles form input and user preferences, reinforcing advanced React practices like `useCallback`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`.
